The script is present in this folder with the name of loader_sh but when you use for unix you use it as loader.sh for shell script.

Save this file in the root folder : nano /root/tftp/loader.sh.

In the tftp folder palce the openwrt mikrotik v23.05.0 rc3 file also..

Before run this command put the ethernet cable in the wan port of mikrotik router and unplug the power source...now press the reset button.

Now run this shell script loader.sh with the command ./loader.sh.

It run dnsmasq (Dnsmasq is a lightweight and versatile DNS (Domain Name System) forwarder and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) server.)---> if you get error check the port 69 mainly the http services run at that time so you need to close these services and run again the ./loader.sh.

Now power on the mikrotik router while pressing the reset button..dont release the button until first beep on the router.
The dnsmasq upload the intram firmware to the mikrotik router through tftp the logs are display on the screen...


After the firmware upload to the router you need to ping 192.168.1.1 on the web browser the Luci inteface open for the mikrotik router.

Dont close the Luci interface.

First you go to the system--> flashfirmware part here you update the openwrt-ramips-mt7621-mikrotik_routerboard-760igs-squashfs-sysupgrade file that is present in the mt7621 folder.

Now check the packages of strongswam..

you can check it by ssh login to the router in a terminal ssh root@192.168.1.1..
after ssh login you are on the router terminal now write this command opkg list-installed.
you can see all packages that are installed on your router..

(this is important

Warning: use openwrt-23.05.0-rc3 for the first step of the TFTP installation, as the other RCs and the final 23.05.0 version cannot be netbooted due to too high entry point addresses)
